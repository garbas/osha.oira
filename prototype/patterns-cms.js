/* Patterns bundle configuration.
 *
 * This file is used to tell r.js which Patterns to load when it generates a
 * bundle. This is only used when generating a full Patterns bundle, or when
 * you want a simple way to include all patterns in your own project. If you
 * only want to use selected patterns you will need to pull in the patterns
 * directly in your RequireJS configuration.
