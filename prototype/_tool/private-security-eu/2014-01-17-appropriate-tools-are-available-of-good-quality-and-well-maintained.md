**National legislation regulating the carrying of weapons** differs widely from country to country:

  * In some countries private security guards are not allowed to carry firearms.
  * In other countries where this is permitted, there is a whole raft of legal provisions to be complied with regarding gun permits and training in the use and storage of arms.

In general, the use of firearms is limited to certain activities/jobs
(principally for cash in transit, the surveillance of military installations
or facilities of importance to national security, or to the protection of
individuals, i.e. bodyguards).

**Gun-related accidents** may be the result of the firearm accidentally going off, ricochets of bullets and exposure to bullet fragments and other substances, particularly during shooting practice. Accidents are quite rare and often result from negligence or a lack of training. However, they can cause death.

This risk is peculiar to the sector and mainly affects bodyguard activities
and static surveillance of certain specific sites.

**Check the following issues:**

  * **Firearms** should be of good quality, well maintained and properly stored according to local legislation.
  * Other tools, if and when allowed by national provisions, such as OC mace, tear gas, hand cuffs, batons, flashlights, telephones/communication/personal alarm, fluorescent vests, ... should be of good quality and well maintained.
  * **Training** should be provided in the use of firearms (shooting practice and periodical psycho-technical tests) and the use of other tools.
