Some security activities require a series of time considerations to be met.
These must be the object of an agreement between the employer and the  the
client:  operational response times,  frequency of a series of operations, ...
This kind of **time pressure** can be a **source of
[stress](https://osha.europa.eu/en/topics/stress)**, particularly because
unpredictable factors and unforeseen circumstances can lead to failure to
comply with these kinds of requirements.

When workers indicate that they cannot carry out the requested activities
within the time set, the reasons for this must be examined by the employer and
actions must be taken if necessary.
