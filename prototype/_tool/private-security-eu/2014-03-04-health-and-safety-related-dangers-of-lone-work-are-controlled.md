Lone working private security guards arethose who work alone without any
direct or close supervision, generally on small sites which require the work
of a single person.Risks associated with lone working are: being
harassed/attacked, accident or sickness requiring immediate intervention,
having difficulty to deal correctly with emergencies or unforeseen
situations.Although lone working is not prohibited under the European
Directives, it should in principle besubject to a prior analysis of the
related dangers.If in the course of this analysis, serious health and safety
dangers are identified, lone working should be minimised.If conversely, the
analysist reveals that it is possible, the security guard must be given all
the necessary tools in order to be able to do the job in safety and without
health problems.
