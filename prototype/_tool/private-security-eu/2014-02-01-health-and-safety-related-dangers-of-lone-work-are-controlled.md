Lone working private security guards are **those who work alone without any
direct or close supervision**, generally on small sites which require the work
of a single person.

Risks associated with lone working are: being harassed/attacked, accident or
sickness requiring immediate intervention, having difficulty to deal correctly
with emergencies or unforeseen situations.

Although lone working is not prohibited under the European Directives, it
should in principle be **subject to a prior analysis of the related dangers**.

  * If in the course of this analysis, serious health and safety dangers are identified, lone working should be minimised.
  * If conversely, the analysist reveals that it is possible, the security guard must be given all the necessary tools in order to be able to do the job in safety and without health problems.
